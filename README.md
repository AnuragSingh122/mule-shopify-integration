Shopify is a complete commerce platform that lets you start, grow, and manage a business. It is completely cloud-based and hosted, which means you don't have to worry about upgrading or maintaining software or web servers. This gives you the flexibility to access and run your business from anywhere with an internet connection.
The Shopify connector for Anypoint enables users to integrate their applications with Shopify using the Anypoint Platform and seamlessly orchestrate flow of data between Shopify and their CRM, marketing or other cloud-based applications.
